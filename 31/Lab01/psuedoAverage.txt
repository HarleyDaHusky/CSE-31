delcare: int for count, bool for checkpoint, int for count, and int for the input

Set a while loop that'll run infinitely{
    check if count is > 3 and <21
    do count%10 to see base number (if over 10)
    have if statements to determine "st" "nd" "rd" "th"

    Ask for user input of a value with correct count 

    check if value is 0{
        if value is 0, set checkpoint to false
    }

    add user input to total.
    
}

declare two variables for odd/even
declare two new counts for odd/even
add all inputs and add them to the appropriate totals (odd or even)
add 1 for each odd/even added
find average for odd/even
print none (if no average calculated), print 1 (odd or even if other one is empty), or both
