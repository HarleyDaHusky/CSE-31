Individual Assignment 1:

1. Line 22
2. Added a "&" to input to make it register the inputed value into the pointer address.
3. The helper function (read_value()) doesn't calculate the sum properly. 
4. We make sum a pointer throughout the function, this makes it so the code adds input to the address of sum, and it is then accessed via the "&" when read_value() is run.

Individual Assignment 2:
1. Yes
2. No, the second inputs replace every letter of the previous input for how long the len() of the new input is.
3. The output is not expected, the function is probably working weird due to the allocation of 10 slots, however, we are using more than 10.
