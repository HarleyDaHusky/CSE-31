Activity 2:
    1. clang -g punishment.c
    2. lldb ./a.out
    3. run
    4. Essentially placing a point in which the terminal will know to stop there. A way to stop the automated execution at a designated line. To set a breakpoint, 
    To set a breakpoint in a function, you would do - b (funciton name) - and to break at a specific line, - b (functino name).c:(line) -.

Activity 3:
    1. 4 variables, 2 pointers
    2. I think x,y, and arr[0] will be their initialize locations as they don't have an initialized value.
       x = 13795356
       y = 1
       arr[0] = 256
