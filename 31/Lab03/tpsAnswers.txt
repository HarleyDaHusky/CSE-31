Activity 1:
1. Global variables, stack and head. Global variables can store variables that are defined and accessed anywhere. Stack variables are only able to be used within the loop/function depending on where the variable is declared. Heap stores global variables.
2a. 3 variables
2b. 2 pointers, both are int with one of them being 2d and the other being 3d (pointers).
2c. Since these are declared in main, they are local variables for main, and thus they are declared in Stack.
2d. The pointer on line 12 should point to a variable in Stack because it is a local variable.
3. 
4.

Activity 2:
1. The code changes the value of iValue to 5, and the value of fValue to 3.14 through the head function of a Node which basically just iterates the Node "array" to the next value.
3. Structures are stored in memory through iteration of Nodes (similar to arrays). the pointer head, is the start of the Node.

Individual Assignment 1:
1a. To know how many values we need to iterate through to also not step out of bounds. 
1b. Yes,
1c. It is easier to create a new array and store values into the array then change the value in a index of a array.
