Activity 1:
1. 0x00400000
2. Basic shows the instructions but source shows what's being modified
3. 32 bytes
4. 8
5. Nothing?
6. main: add $t0, $0, $zero
7. $a0 = 0x10010004
8. str1: .asciiz "I love CSE31!"
10. 0x10010000 - no it does not match waht we have learned since the letters are all scrambled
11. We load the location where str1 is stored and print out the location
12. After this instruction, $t3 will have the address of n stored within it.

Activity 2:
1. In mips, the order of how you place address carrying values matters. Thus, it is unneeded for MIPS 
to have operators for opposite of > and >=
