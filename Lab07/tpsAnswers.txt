Activity 1:
1. A function returns a value, but a procedure does not. A method is similar to a function, but is internal to part of a class. The term method is used almost exclusively in object-oriented programming.
4. Line 12 jumps to line 20.
5. If we made a label for the line we're jumping back to, then j would work, however, jr $ra returns us to the line that we were at before the function was called, so in this case, jr $ra is better.
6. $v0, 15, no because we know we're going to print out the value immediately after, so storing the sum in $a0 would save a line.
7. An error occurs.
8. 0x00400028
9. Runs without error and returns correct value.
10. New return address is still 0x00400028, still 15
11. jr

Activity 2:
1. 38
2. The main function defines all the values, and sets register $a0 with x value after it goes through the functions sum which calls sub to modify x. 
3. There's a call jr $ra which tells the compiler to return to the line after where the function is called. 
4. Modify the value of $a0 in sub
5. The original value of $s0 would be overwritten and lost. This is a problem because if we needed to access the original value of $s0, we would be unable to.
